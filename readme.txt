Write a method that will sort an array

What type of data needs to be sorted? non-negative integer values

How many pieces of data will there be? don't code statically, have this determined by the amount of input data 

What if invalid data is input? all data will be valid

Is the sorting algorithm efficient? for sorting small arrays of integers, efficiency/ data consumption is not an issue
